# joint_liability
the code for ''evolution of cooperation with joint liability'', arXiv:2109.05634

The is a C program. This project is developed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. To run it, you must make sure that the developing environment have been already configured.

This code is an example to show how the selection intensity affects the stationary frequency of punisher/cooperator/defector (Fig.4b in the paper). 
To investigate other parameters which could affect the frequency of strategies, you only need to change several lines in the function "main" in the source file.

To run it, open "joint_liability_simulation.sln" first. Then, open the source file "evolution.cpp" in Visual studio. Finally, compile and run it. 
All results will be saved in the "generations.txt".
